&lt;p>I had a wonderful time meeting customers and presenting at re:invent &amp;lsquo;24!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="aws-reinvent-2024---you-are-under-a-ddos-attack-are-you-ready-to-respond-cdn306">AWS re:Invent 2024 - You are under a DDOS attack! Are you ready to respond? (CDN306)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Do your operational teams know how to respond in the event of an attack? Have you architected with a DDOS strategy in mind? This talk guides you through the steps that help you react when under attack. Explore AWS tools you should leverage and best practices you can follow to proactively prepare for such scenarios. Learn how to identify and respond to DDOS attacks using services such as Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and AWS Shield Advanced.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>re:invent 2023 - Designing a secure perimeter with cost in mind</title><link>https://etiennemunnich.github.io/posts/reinvent-designing-a-secure-perimeter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://etiennemunnich.github.io/posts/reinvent-designing-a-secure-perimeter/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="protecting-web-application-workfloads-with-aws-shield-and-aws-waf">Protecting Web Application workfloads with AWS Shield and AWS WAF&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>So grateful to have had the chance to co-present a chalk talk at re:invent!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reinvent-2023---designing-a-secure-perimeter-with-cost-in-mind">re:invent 2023 - Designing a secure perimeter with cost in mind&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Co-presentated with Damindra Bandara.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this chalk talk, you will learn how to optimize your monthly AWS spend leveraging Amazon Security Services (Amazon CloudFront, AWS Shield, AWS WAF and AWS Global Accelerator) to design a secure perimeter. This session will outline in detail optimization techniques including: optimizing data egress costs using Savings Bundles, DDoS cost prevention, cost optimized configurations, WAF cost optimization, and visibility options such as usage trends and cost explorer. Attendees will get an opportunity to ask questions regarding their use cases and understand how to save their perimeter security cost.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
