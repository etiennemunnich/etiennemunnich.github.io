&lt;p>So grateful to have had the chance to co-present a chalk talk at re:invent!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reinvent-2023---designing-a-secure-perimeter-with-cost-in-mind">re:invent 2023 - Designing a secure perimeter with cost in mind&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Co-presentated with Damindra Bandara.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this chalk talk, you will learn how to optimize your monthly AWS spend leveraging Amazon Security Services (Amazon CloudFront, AWS Shield, AWS WAF and AWS Global Accelerator) to design a secure perimeter. This session will outline in detail optimization techniques including: optimizing data egress costs using Savings Bundles, DDoS cost prevention, cost optimized configurations, WAF cost optimization, and visibility options such as usage trends and cost explorer. Attendees will get an opportunity to ask questions regarding their use cases and understand how to save their perimeter security cost.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
